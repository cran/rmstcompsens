Description: Performs two-sample comparisons using the restricted mean survival time (RMST) when survival curves end at different time points between groups. This package implements a sensitivity approach that allows the threshold  timepoint tau to be specified after the longest survival time in the shorter survival group. Two kinds of between-group contrast estimators (the difference in RMST and the ratio of RMST) are computed: Uno et al(2014)<doi:10.1200/JCO.2014.55.2208>, Uno et al(2022)<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survRM2>, Ueno and Morita(2023)<doi:10.1007/s43441-022-00484-z>.
